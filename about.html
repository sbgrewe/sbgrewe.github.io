            <p>
                Hello! My name is Spencer Grewe and this is my website. I am a current student in American University's residential Data Science program, 
                and I made this site to collect and show off some of my big and small projects. I am interested in how data science can unravel problems in business,
                healthcare, and the public sector. I am also interested in exploring effective and creative applications of data visualizations such as real-time 
                simulations, animations, and interactive figures.

            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated with a BS in Chemistry from James Madison in 2019, and an MA in Chemistry from the University of Virginia in 2021. I carried out research
                in computational biophysics and biochemistry for about 4 years while working and volunteering in STEM education before exploring a career in data science. 
                I lived in the Shenandoah valley for 7 years and still enjoy walking through trails and public parks in my spare time. 

            </p>
